# Loan-Defaulter-prediction
Identifying the whether the applicant is Loan defaulter or not!!


Libraries that have been used in this model

Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
From sklearn
Scipy
Label Encoder
Model Selection
Decision Tree
Random Forest
From imblearn
Random OverSampling



RESULTS
being a dataset based on the defaulters the percentage of defaulters are really less
approximately the ratio of people who have paid with who has not paid is 1:4
balancing the Dataset for an improved accuracy and f1-score
After splitting the data into train and test we came to know the categorical data needs to be label encoded
Using two different models we came to know Random forest classifier can be used for this data for an improved accuracy
did some hyperparameter tuning on the model to increase the accuracy.



CONCLUSION
The best fit model for this dataset is Random forest classifier with the value of n_estimator parameter at 950
The average accuracy of the model is 85%.
